Core Application code base - caution as Dragons & Librarians! sleep here....

WHAT ARE THESE?

Directories

- lib, base components of core what to teach a dog a new trick? do it here! ie how to talk to a database how to do a thing...

- modules, more complex but still internal aspects of core. concepts like premissions, roles are handled here
*note modules\base, these is proto constructors for the individual application using the framework

Files

core.php - this is the core of the application its what stitches everything together
core.interface - how should all the parts talk...
core.abstract  - whats the parts do

Config.static - how to read the most basic config data...

these need to be together or pretty much nothing works because nothing knows what anythigng else is....
